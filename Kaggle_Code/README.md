# Kaggle_Code
This folder will serve as a backup of previously done Kaggle competitions/experiments, including in-detail explanatory data analysis techniques, various regression techniques and deep learning basics.
Most of my previous projects are stored in a hard disk that is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean
